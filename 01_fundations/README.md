## Variables and Data Types

Variables are fundamental in programming as they allow you to store and manipulate data. In Python, variables can hold different types of data, known as data types. Let's explore some common data types in Python:

### 1. **Numbers**

Python supports various numeric data types, including:

- **Integers (int):** These are whole numbers, such as 1, -5, or 1000.

- **Floating-Point Numbers (float):** These are numbers with decimal points, like 3.14, -0.5, or 1.0.

- **Complex Numbers (complex):** These consist of a real part and an imaginary part, for example, 2 + 3j.

### 2. **Strings**

Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in either single ('') or double ("") quotes. They can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Examples:

```python
name = "John"
sentence = "Hello, World!"
```

You can perform various operations on strings, like concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

### 3. **Lists**

Lists are ordered collections of items. They can contain elements of different data types and are enclosed in square brackets. Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

You can access list elements by their index and manipulate the list by adding, removing, or changing elements.

### 4. **Tuples**

Tuples are similar to lists but are enclosed in parentheses. They are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Example:

```python
coordinates = (2, 3)
```

Tuples are useful when you want to store a set of values that should not be modified.

### 5. **Dictionaries**

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. They are enclosed in curly braces and consist of keys and associated values. Example:

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

You can access dictionary values by their keys and modify the dictionary by adding or updating key-value pairs.

### 6. **Sets**

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are enclosed in curly braces or created using the `set()` constructor. Example:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

Sets are useful for tasks that involve testing membership, finding intersections, unions, and differences between collections.

Learning about these data types and how to work with variables is essential for Python programming. Understanding when and how to use each data type will enable you to effectively store and manipulate different kinds of data in your Python programs.
