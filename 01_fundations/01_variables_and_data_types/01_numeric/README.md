## Numbers in Python

Numbers are one of the fundamental data types in Python. Python provides several types of numbers, which can be used for different purposes. Here are the primary numeric data types in Python:

### 1. **Integers (int)**

Integers are whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional part. Examples of integers include -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. In Python, integers have no maximum or minimum value limitations, and you can perform various mathematical operations on them.

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
y = -10
z = 0
```

### 2. **Floating-Point Numbers (float)**

Floating-point numbers, often referred to as floats, are numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation. They are used to represent real numbers and can have fractional and exponential parts. Examples of floats include 3.14, -0.5, 1.0e-5, and so on.

**Example:**
```python
pi = 3.14159
temperature = 98.6
```

### 3. **Complex Numbers (complex)**

Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part, and they are written in the form `a + bj`, where `a` represents the real part, and `b` represents the imaginary part. Python allows you to work with complex numbers for advanced mathematical calculations and scientific applications.

**Example:**
```python
z = 2 + 3j
w = -1 - 4j
```

Python provides various operators and functions for working with numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and more. You can also use functions like `abs()`, `round()`, and `pow()` to perform specific mathematical operations on numbers.

**Mathematical Operations Example:**
```python
a = 10
b = 3
addition_result = a + b
division_result = a / b
exponent_result = a ** b
```

Understanding these different numeric data types and the operations you can perform with them is crucial when working on mathematical or scientific programming, financial applications, and more. Python's flexibility with numbers makes it a versatile language for various domains.
